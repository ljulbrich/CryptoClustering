# CryptoClustering

## Background

This project uses the K-Means algorithem to cluster price data on cryptocurrencies. The data then has a dimensionality reduction applied to it through PCA, and is then clustered with the K-Means algorithem. The two K-Means clusters are then compared.

## Results

Unsuprisingly, using dimensionality reduction on this dataset created more visually appealing datasets.

## Files

`Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb`
* This is the main jupyter notebook which analyses the code
* This library does not require holoviews to run the graphs
* If any errors occur with this library the import statement can be commented out

`Resources/crypto_market_data.csv`
* This is a sample dataset featuring multiple cryptocurrencies and different price change percentage time periods
